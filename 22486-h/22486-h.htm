<h2>MIXED NOTIONS.</h2>

<p class="center">No. V.&mdash;AGRICULTURAL DEPRESSION.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Scene and Persons as usual.</i>)</p>

<p><i>First Well-informed Man.</i> There hasn't been much in this
debate on the Addresses.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh. I don't know. They've promised a pretty
big list of measures. How they're going to find time for the lot I
can't make out.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>contemptuously</i>). Yes, that's always the way
with these Governments. They all talk mighty big at the beginning
of the Session, and then, at the end, they've done nothing, absolutely
nothing; at least, nothing that's any good to anybody. Parliament's
getting to be nothing but a bear-garden.
The House won't be a
fit place for a gentleman to be
seen in soon.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>spitefully</i>).
You didn't seem to think it would
be such a bad place for one gentleman,
about eight months ago.
You were after a constituency
yourself, weren't you?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, and
what if I was? I told you at the
time why I thought of standing.
I thought I could do some good,
but I precious soon found they
were a miserable lot, so I made
'em my bow. "Gentlemen," I
said, "you can worry it out among
yourselves, and, when you've
agreed, you can let me know."</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> And they
never did let you know, did they?
Went and elected another Johnny.
Deuced bad taste I call it.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>creating a diversion</i>).
Look here, I say, what's all this
talk about Agricultural Depression?
What does it mean?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What does it
mean! Why, my dear chap, I
should have thought that any
schoolboy knew that our agriculture
is being simply ruined. If
things go on like this, we shan't
have a farmer left. They're all
on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>doggedly</i>). I daresay
you're right; but, anyhow, I
know, when I was at Chilborough,
the other day, I saw a lot of
farmers about, and they looked
pretty fat and comfortable. That's
why I can't make out what it all
means.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>resignedly</i>).
Well, I suppose I must explain
it all, from the very beginning.
The first point is, we've got Free
Trade, and the farmers want
Protection; and old <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>
and all the rest of them say they're
not to have it. Well, that isn't
likely to put the farmers in a good
temper, is it? Then, of course,
the Americans, and the Russians, and the Indians see their chance,
and they send ship-loads of food into this country, and the taxes
have to be paid all the same by our farmers.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). What taxes?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>flustered</i>). I wish you wouldn't break in just as
I'm trying to make things clear. Why, the taxes on food, of
course.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> There aren't any taxes on food.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, indeed! Well, then, how do you explain
Free Trade, and rent, and all that?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Now you're getting a bit nearer. It's all a
question of rent. Free Trade's got absolutely nothing to do with it.
What we want in this country is a Sliding-scale.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> What's a Sliding-scale?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>taken between wind and water</i>). A Sliding-scale?
Let me see&mdash;it's very difficult to put these things shortly.
A Sliding-scale is a&mdash;&mdash;well, it's a sort of patent mechanical contrivance
for weighing out things, so as to make it fairer than
ordinary scales do. (<i>Plunges recklessly.</i>) You can make it slide up
or down, you know, and fix it at any point you like.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Really! What a rum-looking thing it must be. Have
you ever seen one?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh yes. They've got two or three in every big
town.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> When did you last see it?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>suspiciously</i>). Oh, I haven't seen one for some
time. It <i>may</i> perhaps be a <i>little</i> different now.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Ah! [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> I see the Government's going to have an inquiry about
Agricultural Distress. How are they going to work it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Royal Commission, of course.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> No, no. It's going to be a Select Committee.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, what is
the difference?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Surely <i>you</i>
know that. They only have Royal
Commissions for labour and that
sort of thing. Committees don't
get any pay, you know.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course. I ought
to have remembered that. But
who's this Lord <span class="sc">Winchilsea
and Nottingham</span>, who's cutting
about the country, talking about
agriculture! What does he know
about it? I don't seem to recollect
his name.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> He's a Peer.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Yes, I know that;
but why do they call him Lord
<span class="sc">Winchilsea</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Nottingham</span>?</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Because that's
his name. [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>resuming</i>). But what
is he driving at?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> He's got hold
of the right end of the stick.
It's just this way. (<i>To</i> Inquirer,
<i>who winces under the imputation</i>.)
You're a foreign country, and I'm
a British farmer. Well, you grow
your corn for nothing, and then
you chuck it into my markets.
Well, what I want to know is,
where do I come in? You may
call that Free Trade, if you like&mdash;I
call it ruin. The result is,
I'm smashed up, and the whole
country goes to the devil!</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> But you
ought to consider the consumer.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What do you
mean by the consumer?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M</i>. Why, myself,
for instance. I get the benefit
of it.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Ah, you may
<i>think</i> you do, but you don't
really. In the end you've all to
pay more for everything.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Well, I'm pretty
happy as things are.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, of course&mdash;and
you'd let the land go
out of cultivation. That's mere
selfishness.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> How's that? Can't they work the land now?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What a question! Of course they can't.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). But I've seen 'em ploughing a bit lately.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> My dear Sir, they do it just to occupy time&mdash;they
must do something.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course&mdash;of course. [<i>Terminus.</i></p>

<p>Our amiable old friend, Mrs. R., came across a book entitled
<i>Playthings and Parodies</i>, by <span class="sc">Barry Pain</span>. "Oh, I <i>must</i> buy
<i>that</i>!" she exclaimed. "I've seen him so often in the Pantomime
at Drury Lane! And fancy his being an Author, too! But I
don't so much wonder at it, because I remember that, when I was
a little girl, there was a celebrated Shakspearian Clown at Astley's
called <span class="sc">Barry</span>, and he sailed in a tub drawn by geese down the
Thames, and there was a wonderful Pantomime actor of the name
of <span class="sc">Pain</span>. And now this talented gentleman turns out to be an
Author as well!!"</p>

<h2>FINALITY.</h2>

<blockquote><p>["He was one of those who believed
that, even in the ordinary legislation
of the House, and still more in a
measure of such complexity, it was
the utmost folly to talk of finality!"&mdash;<i>Mr.
J. Redmond the Home-Rule
Bill.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Are our sage legislators, then, set upon finding</p>
<p>A measure that's "final, conclusive, and binding,"</p>
<p>As lawyer-phrase puts it? They might as well try</p>
<p>To fix dawn in the East, or nail clouds to the sky!</p>
<p>There's nothing that's "final" in infinite time,</p>
<p>That great, goalless, measureless race-course sublime?</p>
<p>In which relays of runners must keep up the race?</p>
<p>There's nothing "conclusive" in limitless space;</p>
<p>And "binding" man's soul to his best of to-day</p>
<p>For the future of growth, in an absolute way,</p>
<p>Were folly as futile as binding an oak</p>
<p>To the seedling's first prop, or the sapling's first yoke;</p>
<p>For provisional law, not for secular life,</p>
<p>Such phrases are fit. Yet to heal age-long strife</p>
<p>By the very best "betterment" now in our ken,</p>
<p>Till&mdash;a better shines forth's the first duty of men.</p>
<p>Do right to the height of our sight's actuality!&mdash;</p>
<p>Yes, that is our best&mdash;and our only&mdash;Finality!</p>

<p>An odd Advertisement frequently
catches our eye. It is
"<i>Dr. Gordon Stables's Health

anything to do with "the Gordon

evidently they could work together
to their mutual benefit.</p>

only are the governing and governed.

Home Rule, domestically, means
Female sovereignty. In the Isle

to amuse our little boy, aged fourteen, when
he returns home for Easter Vacation?" Why,
certainly improve his mind. Procure for him
a free admission to the Geological Society,
and let him hear a paper on "Anthracite

"Inclusions of Tertiary Granite." Take him
to the Linnean Society, and treat him to a
lecture "On the Differentiation of the Protozoan
Body Microscopically Sectionised."
Another evening may be given to "Mosses and
Sphagnums," not to be confounded with
"Moses and Magnums." After this little
course, he may write to say that during
the next vacation he would prefer remaining

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Story in Scenes.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">Scene VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>In the Drawing-room&mdash;Time, about 10.</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Bodfish</span>
<i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Ditchwater</span> <i>are talking in confidential undertones
on a settee</i>. Miss <span class="sc">Bugle's</span> <i>anxiety concerning her invalid
Cockatoo has already obliged her to depart</i>. Mrs. <span class="sc">Gilwattle</span>
<i>is lecturing her Niece on a couch by the fire, while little</i>
<span class="sc">Gwendolen</span> <i>is in a corner with a Picture-book</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Bodfish</i> (<i>in a wheezy whisper</i>). If he had condescended to
make himself agreeable all round, I shouldn't say a <i>word</i>; but to
sit there talking to that little forward governess, and never an
audible word from first to last&mdash;well, I quite felt for poor dear
Mrs. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span> being so neglected at her own table.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ditch.</i> Ah, my dear, if she <i>will</i> have the aristocracy to dine
with her, she must put up with such treatment. I wouldn't stoop
to such presumption myself. And, if I <i>did</i>, I <i>would</i> have a couple
of <i>entr&eacute;es</i>, and everything
carved <i>off</i> the
table! He'll go away
with such a poor opinion
of us all!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bod.</i> He must
have noticed how the
vegetable dishes were
chipped! And I'm
sure I was ashamed to
see she had put out
those old-fashioned
doyleys with the finger-glasses.
I wonder she
never thought of getting
some new ones. I
saw some the other day
in the Grove, hand-worked,
at only five-pence
three-farthings!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ditch.</i> I could
see <i>something</i> was
weighing on her mind,
or she'd have talked
more to him. What is
his title? It sounded
like "<span class="sc">Stratspoddle</span>."
I must look it out in my
Peerage. Would he be
an Earl now, or what?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bod.</i> I don't
expect he's more than
a Viscount, if so much.
I do think she might
have <i>presented</i> us to
him, though!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ditch.</i> It isn't
the fashion to introduce,
nowadays. But
I consider we are quite
entitled to speak to him,
if we get an opportunity&mdash;in
fact, he would
think it very odd if we
didn't! (<i>&amp;c., &amp;c.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gilwattle.</i> Well,
<span class="sc">Maria</span>, I say, as I said
before, don't let it <i>turn
your head</i>, that's all!
Depend upon it, this
young nobleman isn't
so affable for nothing.
He wouldn't dine with
you like this unless he
expected to get <i>something</i> out of it. What that something may be,
you best know!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). A guinea, at the very least! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
I'm sorry you think my head's so easily turned, Aunt <span class="sc">Joanna</span>!
If you'd noticed how I behaved to him, you wouldn't say so. Why,
I scarcely <i>spoke</i> to the man!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gilw.</i> I was <i>watching</i> you, <span class="sc">Maria</span>. And sorry I was to see
that being next to a member of the nobility overawed you to that
extent you could hardly open your mouth. So unlike your Uncle
<span class="sc">Gabriel</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>hurt at this injustice</i>). Overawed, indeed! I'm sure it
was no satisfaction to <i>me</i> to see him here! No, Aunt the only people
I welcome at <i>my</i> table are those in my own rank of life&mdash;relations
and old friends like you and the others. And how you can think
I was dazzled by a trumpery title when I sent him in with the
Governess&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gil.</i> Ah, you make too much of that girl, <span class="sc">Maria</span>. I've
noticed it, and <i>others</i> have noticed it. She takes too much upon herself!
The <i>idea</i> of letting her forbid <span class="sc">Gwendolen</span> to recite&mdash;no wonder
your authority over the child is weakened! I should have <i>insisted</i>
on obedience.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>roused</i>). I hope I know how to make my own child obey
me. <span class="sc">Gwendolen</span>, come out of that corner. Put down your book.
(<span class="sc">Gwen</span>. <i>obeys</i>.) I wish you to repeat something to your Auntie&mdash;what
you refused to say downstairs&mdash;<i>you</i> know what I mean!</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> Do you mean the thing Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> said I wasn't to,
because you'd be angry?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>majestically</i>).
Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> had
no business to know
whether I should be
angry or not. She is
only your Governess&mdash;<i>I</i>
am your Mother. And
I shall be extremely
angry if you don't
repeat it at once&mdash;in
fact, I shall send you
off to bed. So you can
choose for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> I don't want
to go to bed ... I'll
tell, if I may whisper it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> Well, if
you are too shy to speak
out loud, you <i>may</i>
whisper. You see, Aunt,
I am not <i>quite</i> such a
cipher as you fancied!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="sc">Gwen</span>. <i>puts her mouth
to</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Gilwattle's</span>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">Scene IX.</span>&mdash;<i>Breakfast-room&mdash;Time,

Scene.</i> Mr.
<span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span>, <i>after proposing
to "join the

<i>has brought
him in here on the

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>carefully
closing the door</i>). I only
just wanted to tell you
that I don't at all like
the way you've been
going on. It's not my
wish to make complaints,
but there <i>is</i> a
limit!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>hotly</i>).
There <i>is</i>&mdash;you're very
near it now, Sir! (<i>To

with this little beggar,
I shan't see <span class="sc">Marjory</span>!
(<i>Controlling his temper.</i>)
Perhaps you'll kindly
let me know what you
complain of?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> Well, why
couldn't you say you
didn't smoke when my Uncle offered you one of his cigars? You
must have felt me kick you under the table!</p>

<p><i>Lord. Strath.</i> I did&mdash;distinctly. But I gave you credit for its being
accidental. And, if you wish to know, I said I smoked because I
do. I don't see why you should expect me to <i>lie</i> about it!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> I don't agree with you. I consider you ought to have
had more tact, after the hint I gave you.</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> It didn't occur to me that you were trying to kick
<i>tact</i> into me. And, naturally, when I saw your Uncle about to
smoke&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> That was different, as you might have known. Why,
<i>one</i> cigar is as much as my wife can stand!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> You&mdash;er&mdash;wouldn't wish her to smoke <i>more</i> than
one, surely?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span><p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>outraged</i>). My wife smoke! Never did such a thing
in her life! She don't allow <i>me</i> to smoke. She wouldn't allow
Mr. <span class="sc">Gilwattle</span> if he wasn't her Uncle. And I can tell you, when
she comes down in the morning, and finds the curtains smelling of
smoke, and hears you were the <i>other</i>, I shall catch it!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Sorry for you&mdash;but if you had only made your kick
a trifle more explanatory&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> That's not <i>all</i>, Sir. When you saw me and my Uncle
engaged in talking business, what did you cut in for with a cock-and-bull
story about the Boxing Kangaroo being formed into a
Limited Company, and say the Kangaroo was going to join the Board
after allotment? You couldn't really believe the beast was eligible
as a Director&mdash;an <i>animal</i>, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Why not? They have <i>guinea-pigs</i> on the Board
occasionally, don't they? But of course it was only a joke.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> You weren't <i>asked</i> to make jokes. My Uncle doesn't
understand 'em&mdash;no more do I, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> No, I gathered that. (<i>Breaking out.</i>) Confound it
all, Sir, what do you mean by this? If you didn't want me, why
couldn't you tell me so? You knew it before <i>I</i> did! I don't understand
your peculiar ideas of hospitality. I've kept my temper as
long as I could; but, dash it all, if you force me to speak out, I
will!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>alarmed</i>). No, no, I&mdash;I meant no offence&mdash;you won't go
and let everything out now! It was a mistake, that's all&mdash;and there's
no harm done. You got your <i>dinner</i> all right, didn't you? By the
way, talking of that, can you give me any idea what they'll charge
me for this, eh? What's the <i>regular</i> thing now?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Extraordinary little bounder&mdash;wants
me to price his dinner for him! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Couldn't give a guess!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> Well, considering I sent round and all that, I think they
ought to make <i>some</i> reduction&mdash;y'know. But <i>you</i>'ve nothing to do
with that, eh? I'm to settle up with <span class="sc">Blankley's</span>?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I should say he would prefer your doing so&mdash;but it's
really no business of mine, and&mdash;er&mdash;it's getting rather late&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>opening the door</i>). There, we'll go up. And look here,
<i>do</i> try and be a bit stiffer with my Uncle. It's too bad the way he
goes on my-lording you, y'know. You shouldn't encourage him!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I wasn't aware I <i>did</i>. (<i>To himself.</i>) Trying, this.
But never mind, I shall see <span class="sc">Marjory</span> in another minute!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). The <i>airs</i> these chaps give themselves! Oh,

knew! [<i>He follows them upstairs uneasily.</i></p>

I don't allow any social prejudices to stand in the way. I should say
just the same if you were a mere nobody. We ought to see <i>more</i> of

honour me and my wife by dropping in to a little dinner some
evening; no ceremony; just a few quiet pleasant people like ourselves.
We'll see if we can't fix a day with my wife.</p>

<h2>SUGGESTIONS FOR RIDE PARK.</h2>

<p>"Many improvements," the <i>Daily News</i> writes, "in the arrangement
of the Parks in the West End" have been made. Have they?
Perhaps visible to the eye assisted by <i>Mr. Weller's</i> "pair o'
patent double million magnifyin' gas microscopes of hextra power."
But why, for the hundredth time we ask, and every equestrian asks
as well, why aren't rides made across Kensington Gardens from
Princes' Gate to Bayswater? Beautiful rides they would be under
the trees, and thus varying the wearisome monotony of the round
and round squirrel-in-a-cage sort of routine exercise, to which the
Rotten-Row Riders are purgatorially bound. Also, why not a ride
right across Hyde Park from the Achilles Statue to an exit facing
about Albion Street, Bayswater? What difficulties can there be
which a First Commissioner of Works representing an actively Liberal
and Progressive policy could not carry out for the benefit of the
Mounted Liver Brigade and the Light Cavalry?</p>

<p>Old Father Thames is still rather dirty. We often hear of "The

<h2>A BIG LION AMONG THE LITTLE 'UNS.</h2>

<p>"Daniel in the Lions' Den" will occur to many on reading how
<span class="sc">Henry Irving</span> ventured into and actually dined as the distinguished
guest of a society styling itself "The Playgoers' Club." But
after all, whether these were real leonine cubs, or only "lions
stuffed with straw," the Real Lion of the evening was the Daniel
come to Judgment, <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>, who, having partaken of the
"chicken and champagne," and acknowledged the goodness thereof,
gave them the less smooth side of his own tongue with charming
frankness.</p>

<p>"I do not hesitate to tell you," purred the Lion, sweetly, "that
there have been times when the genius of frankness which possesses
the Club"&mdash;he did not allude to the existence among them of any
other sort of genius&mdash;"has not appeared to be allied with the
finest discrimination. (<i>Laughter.</i>)"</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;the poor little Lions laughed&mdash;it was all they could do,
unless they had whimpered, and promised not to offend again.
It must have been a delightful evening. To what other banquets
will our leading Histrion be invited? To the Pittites' Club
Dinner? To the Wreckers' Banquet? Will he be entertained
by the Dissentient Gallery-Boys' Club, and finish up with a
supper strictly confined to the upper Circles' Society? Instead of
"Give your orders, Gents&mdash;the Waiter's in the room!" of old
days, the Chairman will probably advise the enterprising Playgoers
to "Ask for 'orders,' Gents&mdash;the Manager's in the room." However,
if these heaven-born dramatic critics occasionally hear a few
words of good advice from so honest a guest as <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>, such
gatherings may perhaps serve some useful purpose.</p>

<h2>THE POLITE SPEAKER.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Intended for the use of courteous Members of Parliament.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> I trust you quite acknowledge that strong language is
absolutely unnecessary in Westminster?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Quite, especially when a compensating description can be
found for every suitable term of abuse.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> You grasp the idea. How would you describe <span class="sc">Nero</span> fiddling
during the burning of Rome?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I should say that he was a musician with a turn for pleasing
variations.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Very good. And how would you speak of <span class="sc">Guy Faux</span> on the
eve of blowing up the House of Commons?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> An experimentalist who would have been a useful lecturer
upon chemistry at the Royal Institution.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And could you refer to <i>Blue Beard</i> after the discovery of the
cause of his last widowerhood without giving offence?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; as a married man who objected on principle to the
Mormon practice of being wedded to more than one wife at a time.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Yes. And what would you say of <span class="sc">Marie de Medicis</span>, who is
reported to have fired at the Huguenots from the Louvre?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I should say that her late Majesty took such an interest in
field sports, as nowadays would have secured her election to the
Gun Club.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And, lastly, were you asked to describe <span class="sc">Henry the Eighth</span>
after he had slaughtered most of his wives, plundered all the monasteries,
and imprisoned or executed many of his subjects, what would
you call him?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Without hesitation I should refer to him as "an excited
politician."</p>

Says he hears I'm in want of Easter Offerings,
so he offers to "put me on to a good thing for
the Derby." I am, apparently, to forward
him a £5 note, and he returns me £50
"without fail." Tempting, but haven't got
a £5 note to send.</p>

<p>Arrival at my quiet Vicarage of a donkey,
a cow, two pigs, and a dozen barndoor
fowls! Perhaps, in honour of the pigs, I
might call this a "sow Easter!" The whole
menagerie sent by neighbouring farmers.
Wish they'd send me arrears of rent for
glebe instead; yet I daren't ask for them.
Evidently intended as Easter "gifts in
kind;" but not the kind I want. Send
donkey on to Curate, and tether cow in back-yard,
not having a field. Pigs temporarily
accommodated in back kitchen. Cook
threatens to give notice.</p>

<p>Church. Offertory goes to <i>me</i> to-day!
Don't half like it. Feel like a schoolboy
expecting to be tipped. Curate rather glum.
Finds he thinks my sending the donkey to
him was meant to insult him. When I assure
him it wasn't, he cheers up, and says he'll
hold the plate. Does so. Seems very heavy.
Curate distinctly winks at me, which is
against the Rubrics, no doubt, but still
seems to be an augury of happy tidings about
the sum collected. On his way to Vestry,
Curate whispers to me "Two-fifty!" What
does he mean? Is it two fifty pounds, or
shillings? It's neither&mdash;it's <i>pence</i>! Really,
if this is all the "loyal laity" can do, I may
as well disestablish myself.</p>

<p>Best Easter Offering of all comes by post.
Offer of position as Under-Cashier in a firm
of eminent Bone-boilers. Write to accept
offer with thanks. Better to boil bones for
other people than to have all the flesh taken
off my own.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span><h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 13.</i>&mdash;House filled from
floor to topmost range of gallery. Terrible rumour that it is also
peopled underneath. Members sitting on two front benches
evidently restless through opening passages of Mr. G.'s speech.
Weird whispering heard, apparently rising from boots of <span class="sc">First Lord</span>
of the <span class="sc">Treasury</span>. <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> pricks up his ears; fancies he
recognises voice familiar in Harley Street. First thought, whispered
commentary must come from Ladies' Gallery. Right Hon. Gentlemen
look up, and conclude it is too remote. Besides, Ladies <i>never</i>
talk in the Gallery.</p>

<p>"Moreover than which," said <span class="sc">Fergusson</span>, staring stolidly at
open network of iron floor, "it comes from quite different quarter."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/094.png"><img width="100%" src="images/094.png" alt="" /></a><h3>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TAKING THEIR SEATS, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1893.</h3></div>

<p>Even Mr. G., absorbed as he was with great topic, evidently
noticed the odd state of things, for towards end of magnificent
speech he dropped his voice right down through the grating into the
chamber below, so that Strangers in distant Gallery lost the purport
of his words. Above-board&mdash;or rather above iron grating&mdash;House
presented spectacle worthy of occasion. Last time anything like it
seen was in April, 1886, when first Home-Rule Bill introduced.
Singularly like it this afternoon, with chairs blocking the floor
in fashion to which <span class="sc">Lord-Chamberlain</span>, looking down from Peers'
Gallery, admitted he would not permit in any other theatre. Side-galleries
filled; Members thronging Bar, sharing the steps of
<span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Chair, peeping round from behind its recess, sitting on
the Gangway steps. The Lords' Gallery thronged, with somewhat
disorderly fringe of Viscounts jostling each other on the steps. Not
an inch of room to spare in the Diplomatic Gallery, whilst happy
strangers rose tier beyond tier on the benches behind. Over the
clock H.R.H., <i>debonnaire</i> as usual, able to extract fullest pleasure
and interest out of passing moment. By his side, his son and heir;
not the one who sat there on the April night nine years ago, but the
younger brother, with Cousin <span class="sc">May</span> facing him through the <i>grille</i> of
Ladies' Gallery. Many other gaps filled up on floor of House, the
biggest those created by the flitting of <span class="sc">Bright</span> and <span class="sc">Parnell</span>.</p>

<p>The figure at table answering to Speaker's call, the "<span class="sc">First Lord</span>
of the <span class="sc">Treasury</span>" is the same, though different. Marvellously
little different, considering all that has passed since '86, and remembering
the weight of added years when they come on top of fourscore.
Scantier the hair, paler the face and more furrowed; but the form
still erect, the eye flashing, the right hand beating vigorously, as of
yore, on the long-suffering box; the voice even better than it was
for a certain period towards close of 1880 Parliament; the mental
vision as clear; the fancy as luxuriant; the logic as irresistible;
the musical swing of the stately sentences as harmonious. For two
hours and a quarter, unfaltering, unfailing, Mr. G. held the
unrivalled audience entranced, and sat down amid a storm of
cheering, looking almost as fresh as the posy in his button-hole.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Mr. G. introduces Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Colonel Saunderson</span> going about to-day just as if
nothing had happened yesterday. <i>But something did.</i> Little misunderstanding
arose in connection with appropriation of a Seat. The
Colonel, of course, in the row at the door of the House, between
eleven and noon. Two hundred Members waiting to get in as soon
as doors opened. "Nothing like it seen in civilised world since the
rush for Oklahoma," says Lord <span class="sc">Playfair</span>, who has been in the
United States. "Then, you remember, the intending settlers,
gathering from all parts, bivouacked on line marked by military,
and on appointed day, at fixed hour, at sound of gun, made the
dash into the Promised Land. Lack some of those particulars here.
But the passion just the same; equally reckless; every man first,
and the Sergeant-at-Arms take the hindmost."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Playfair</span> himself came down two hours later, intending to take
his seat in Peers' Gallery, but, finding another mob at entrance,
almost as turbulent, concluded he would not add to the tumult by
wrestling with anybody for a place in the front rank. So, meeting
a Bishop, who had come down with similar intent and abandoned
endeavour from analogous reason, they went for a walk in the Park.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Saunderson</span> not a man of that kind. Thoroughly enjoyed himself
for exciting three-quarters of hour. Was in first flight of heated
and dishevelled senators who crossed the Bar when door flung open,
and elderly Messenger was simultaneously flattened at back of it.
<span class="sc">Saunderson</span> dropped on to first convenient seat; folded his arms;
beginning to view the scene when, like the person in the pastoral
poem, "he heard a voice which said,"&mdash;"You're sitting on my hat!"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Colonel, genially recognising Irish Member of
same Province, but another faith, "now you mention it, I thought I
did hear something crunch." On examination, found remains of hat.</p>

<p>"Come out of my seat!" said the other Ulster man.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Then I'll take you!" said the Ulster man.</p>

<p>"Do so," said the Colonel. Ulster man seized Colonel by collar
and coat, and tugged violently. Rest of conversation was carried on
with the Ulster man lying on his back, at full length, partly under
his seat. "There was no hat here when I arrived," said the Colonel.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span><div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/095.png"><img width="100%" src="images/095.png" alt="" /></a><h3>MR. PUNCH'S HISTORICAL CARTOONS. MR. G.'S ROOM IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</h3></div>

<p>"Then how did it get there?" said the Ulster man, under the
seat.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>
<p>"That's for you to explain," said the Colonel, politely assisting
Ulster man to rise. "If, when a gentleman is taking his seat,
an Hon. Member places his hat upon it, accidents will happen."</p>

<p>Ulster man threatens to bring question under notice of <span class="sc">Speaker</span>.
"Begad, I hope he will," said the Colonel, smiling grimly. "If
you know the gentleman, <span class="sc">Toby</span>, tell him I'll keep him in hats
through Leap Year if he'll only do it. I should like to give the
House an unadorned narrative of the incident. <span class="sc">John Roche's</span>
deer-stealing story would be nothing to it."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Grandolph</span> back again at old post on Front Opposition
Bench. All the Parliamentary world gathered to greet him. H.R.H.
in old familiar seat over clock, whence, up to Monday, his pleasant
presence had long been missed. Not a seat vacant on
floor of House. Galleries crammed, whilst, through <i>grille</i>
of Ladies' Gallery, bright eyes rained influence. <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>
had arranged to resume Debate on Home-Rule
Bill; should have come on bright and fresh as soon as
questions were over. Meanwhile sat on Front Opposition
Bench, awaiting the signal to dash in. Incessantly
playing with beard, in fashion that testified to
high state of nervousness.</p>

<p>Everything excellently planned, the man, the hour,
and the surroundings. Only thing forgotten was the
dog&mdash;dog, you know, that has a little place down at
Epsom, and turns up on course just as the ranged horses
are straining at the bit, and the flag is upheld for the
fall. On this occasion, Irish dog, of course. Introduced
in artfullest way. <span class="sc">Esmonde</span>, mildest-mannered man
that ever whipped for Irish party, casually, as if he
were inviting him to have a cigarette, asked <span class="sc">Wolmer</span>
across House whether it was true that he had called
Irish Members "forty paid mercenaries"? <span class="sc">Wolmer</span>, an
equally well-dressed, civil-spoken young man, smilingly
admitted that it was quite true he had couched a remark
in the terms quoted, but had certainly not meant anything
offensive to Irish Members. Indeed, general aspect
of noble Lord, and his tone, suggested feeling of surprise
that <span class="sc">Esmonde</span> and his friends should not rather have
felt complimented by the observation challenged.</p>

<p>This turned out to be polite crossing of swords before
duel to the death, a shaking of hands before deadly
set-to without gloves. <span class="sc">Sexton</span> suddenly dashed in,
and, with back-handed stroke at <span class="sc">Wolmer</span>, went for
the <i>Times</i> who had adopted and improved upon the
Viscount's genial remarks. Assault admirably planned;
carried on with irresistible vigour, sweeping down
earlier resistance of <span class="sc">Speaker</span>. Showed what <span class="sc">Sexton</span>
can do when so deeply moved as to forget himself, and
resist besetting temptation to play the fatal windbag.</p>

<p>An hour-and-half's tussle all round House; at end
Irish held the field, and, without dissentient voice, <i>Times</i>
article declared to be "gross and scandalous breach of
privileges of House."</p>

<p>But the hour and half had passed, and with it <span class="sc">Randolph's</span>
chance of supreme success. House of Commons,
though greedy for excitement, will never stand two doses
in quick succession. After scene like that, which to-night
filled House with fire and smoke, anything that follows is anti-climax.
It was a cruel fate, which <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> bore uncomplainingly,
and fought against with quiet courage. Painfully nervous
when he broke the silence of two years, the still crowded House had
difficulty in catching his opening sentences. But, as he went on,
he recovered himself, and regained mastery over an audience
evidently eager to welcome his permanent return to position of old
supremacy.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;The Wanderer returned. Slow music. Air&mdash;"<i>Come,
Kill the fatted Calf.</i>"</p>

<p><i>Saturday</i>, 12:50, <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Mr. G. just brought in Home-Rule Bill,
amid ringing cheers from Ministerialists, who rise to their feet, and
wildly wave their hats as <span class="sc">Premier</span> passes to table. Been some
effective speaking on this last night of Debate. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>,
<span class="sc">Blake</span>, and <span class="sc">John Morley</span>, each excellent in varied way. Only
few Members present to hear <span class="sc">Bodkin</span> insert maiden speech in dinner-hour.
A remarkable effort, distinguished, among other things, by
necessity of <span class="sc">Speaker</span> twice interposing, second time with ominous
threat that <span class="sc">Bodkin</span> could not be tolerated much longer. <span class="sc">Bodkin</span>,
resuming thread of his discourse, humbly apologised, kept his eye
(<span class="sc">Bodkin's</span> eye) warily on <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, and, when he saw him preparing
to rise for third time, abruptly resumed his seat,&mdash;returned
hurriedly to the needle-case, so to speak,&mdash;and thus avoided worse
things.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Home-Rule Bill read a First Time.</p>

<h2>REAL "DIPLOMACY."</h2>

<p>No doubt of it! A great diplomatic stroke on the part of
Mr. <span class="sc">John Hare</span> is this revival of <i>Diplomacy</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, <span class="sc">Sardou's</span> <i>Dora</i>
in an English-made dress&mdash;at the Garrick Theatre. An unequivocal
success (of which more "in our next") on Saturday night for everybody;
and, after the Play was over, the audience, inspired by
"the gods," called Mr. and Mrs. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span> before the curtain.
Mrs. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span>, in the course of an admirable little speech, said,
"If I stood here till next week, I should not be able to express all I
feel." Now as, by the right time, it was exactly 11:54 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> <i>Saturday
night</i>, this clever lady would certainly <i>not</i> have been able in the
time to express all she felt, or to say all she would have liked to say,
seeing there were only six minutes left before "next week" began.</p>
